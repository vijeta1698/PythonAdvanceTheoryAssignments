    "<p>Overloading, in the context of programming, refers to the ability of a function or an operator to behave in different ways depending on the parameters that are passed to the function, or the operands that the operator acts on. In this article, we will see how we can perform function overloading and operator overloading in Python.</p>\n",
    "<p>Overloading a method fosters reusability. For instance, instead of writing multiple methods that differ only slightly, we can write one method and overload it. Overloading also improves code clarity and eliminates complexity.</p>\n",
    "<p>Overloading is a very useful concept. However, it has a number of disadvantages associated with it. Overloading can cause confusion when used across inheritance boundaries. When used excessively, it becomes cumbersome to manage overloaded functions.</p>\n",
    "<p>Depending on how the function has been defined, we can call it with zero, one, two, or even many parameters. This is referred to as \"function overloading\".</p>\n",
    "<p>Function overloading is further divided into two types: overloading built-in functions and overloading custom functions. We will look at both the types in the upcoming sections.</p>\n",
    "<p>Python allows us to change the default behavior of an operator depending on the operands that we use. This practice is referred to as \"operator overloading\".</p>\n",
    "<p>The functionality of Python operators depends on built-in classes. However, the same operator will behave differently when applied to different types. A good example is the \"+\" operator. This operator will perform an arithmetic operation when applied on two numbers, will concatenate two strings, and will merge two lists.</p>"
