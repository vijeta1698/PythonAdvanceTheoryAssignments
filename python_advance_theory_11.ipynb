Hold on to that thought. We will cover it further in a few. We also notice that the <span style=\"background:gray; padding:5px; border-radius:5px;\">type</span> of type itself is type.

    "<p>Now that those two concepts are out of the way, we realize that Python creates the classes using a metaclass. We have seen that everything in Python is an object, these objects are created by metaclasses. Whenever we call class to create a class, there is a metaclass that does the magic of creating the class behind the scenes. We've already seen type do this in practice above. It is similar to str that creates strings and int that creates integers. In Python, the ___class__attribute enables us to check the type of the current instance. Let's create a string below and check its type.</p>"
